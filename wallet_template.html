<h3>What do I need to do with this paper?</h3>

This paper represents actual value in Bitcoins. You have a couple of options:
<ol>
    <li>Just keep this paper in a safe place. Make a copy of this paper and store in another safe place.
        And wait till Bitcoins are worth triljons each (or 0 no one knows...)</li>
    <li>Exchange them for valuable and well known Euro's. Follow the instructions to create a wallet below
    and use a site such as https://bitonic.nl to get the value of your bitcoins wired to you on an IBAN bank account.</li>
    <li>Spend them on pizza (https://thuisbezorgd.nl), vaporizers (https://vaposhop.com/), chocolate and more
    (https://www.eco-logisch.nl/) or of course the well-known Azarius (https://azarius.net)</li>
    <li>Or any combination of the above. But remember if you take the bitcoins of this paper wallet
        transfer them all in once for safety reasons
    </li>
</ol>

<h3>Create a wallet</h3>

<p>Install a bitcoin wallet on your phone or PC such as Mycelium (or Electrum or any other wallet).
When you create a new wallet remember to create a backup, preferably write down your keys and password
    on a piece of paper. If you loose your phone you can restore your bitcoins with these keys, but if
you loose your keys your bitcoins are lost.
If you choose to install Mycelium, you can easily transfer the Bitcoins from this paper if you go to the
main menu and select 'Cold Storage', then select 'QR code' to scan the Private Key on this paper.</p>
